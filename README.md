# bjerke.dev @ github pages
This repository generates [bjerke.dev](https://bjerke.dev).

## About
The motivation for the project is to create a playground for sharing projects, ideas and interests.  

I have no experience and limited interest as far as web-development is concerned, and the site will __not__ be a typical portfolio-site populated with FAANG clones. Nonetheless, I desire to learn the essentials of js/ts/react/next, especially considering the rise of intertwined client/server interface for frameworks such as next.

For the time being, the site is completely static, and so github pages is convenient for hosting.

## TODO
1. ~~Decide core tools/libs/frameworks~~
2. ~~Create a basic prototype~~
3. ~~Configure DNS and setup redirection~~
4. ~~Set up github actions workflow to deploy site~~
5. Land on a layout for the site
6. Automate creation of index or meta section of the page from this readme and changelog.md
7. Evaluate 


Might [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com), but will probably keep it very simple.
